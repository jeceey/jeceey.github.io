        <h1 class="notf-title">404 Not Found</h1>
        <p class="notf-text">Welcome, traveler. You've reached a page that doesn't exist, a place where content used to be-or maybe never
            was.
            Let's take this moment to pause and reflect.</p>
        <p class="notf-text">Take a deep breath in, and let it out slowly. Notice the space around you, empty yet full of possibility.
            Imagine that each exhale clears away confusion, leaving room for clarity.</p>
        <p class="notf-text">As you sit with this blank page, know that it's okay to be here. You've discovered something unexpected, and
            that's part of the journey. Gently release any frustration, knowing that every path leads somewhere
            —even this one.</p>
        <p class="notf-text">Now, when you're ready, slowly return to your search.
            Trust that the right page, the right information, will appear when you need it. Take another deep breath,
            and
            when you exhale, click back or try again. The internet, like life, is full of surprises.</p>
