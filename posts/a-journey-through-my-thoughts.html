            <p>Welcome to this blog, and thank you, truly, for taking the time to stop by. Your curiosity, your interest, perhaps even your enthusiasm, mean more than you know.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p class="post-p">This space is, above all, a reflection of my curiosities. I don't claim to be an expert in the topics I explore; I approach them as a thinker in motion, driven by a genuine desire to understand. What you'll find here are reflections, questions, and lessons gathered along the way - thoughts in progress, shared in good faith.</p>

            <p class="post-quotes post-p">
                As Montaigne writes: "I do not teach, I relate."<br><em>(Essays, Book III, Chapter 2, "Of Repentance")</em>
            </p>

            <p class="post-p">This blog accompanies me in my explorations, at the crossroads of academic study, personal reflection, and intellectual wandering. I write at no fixed pace, just as ideas emerge, resonate, or demand a deeper look. There is no promise of regularity here, only the desire to write when something rings true.</p>

            <p class="post-p">I'm interested in a wide range of topics, from philosophy to biology, mathematics, economic models, and social dynamics. What draws me in are not definitive answers, but meaningful questions, those that open rather than close thought.</p>

            <p class="post-p">As a native French speaker, this blog is also an opportunity for me to improve my written English. Please be kind if some sentences sound a bit off or if my language feels awkward. And feel free to point out mistakes, I'm always eager to learn.</p>

            <p class="post-p">If you feel moved to contribute with a correction, a new perspective, a reference, or an idea worth chasing, please do so in the comments. I'd be glad to engage. After all, that's part of what this space is for: thinking aloud, together.</p>

            <p class="post-p">See you in the comments, or perhaps at the bend of an idea.</p>
            <br>
